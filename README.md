# Spring Boot Network Chasis

Spring Boot Network Chasis is a web-based application designed to help users easily create and manage networks. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for creating, configuring, and managing network components, such as routers, switches, and firewalls.

## Getting Started

To get started with Spring Boot Network Chasis, you'll need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Once you have Java installed, you can download the latest version of Spring Boot Network Chasis from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spring-boot-network-chasis/spring-boot-network-chasis). You can either download the source code and build the application yourself, or download the pre-built binary.

To start the application, simply run the following command:

```sh
java -jar spring-boot-network-chasis.jar
```

This will start the application on the default port (8080).

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. From there, you can create and manage networks, add components to the network, and configure their settings.

The application provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating networks and adding components. You can easily connect components by dragging a cable between them.
